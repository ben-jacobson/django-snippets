Todo list

- Write some view or model unit tests that check ordering

- Refactor your views to use REVERSE lookups, that way if you change URL structuring, your tests will still pass

- Look into the possibility of refactoring your views so that they are class based

- Write a functional test for a publish button in the admin site.
