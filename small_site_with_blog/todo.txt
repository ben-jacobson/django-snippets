Todo list

- You can set up the date_published field to auto populate on default, without having to overwrite the save function. see this page and how they implemented it : https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_models/    
    created_date = models.DateTimeField(
            default=timezone.now)
    published_date = models.DateTimeField(
            blank=True, null=True)

- Look into the possibility of refactoring your views so that they are class based

- Write a functional test for a publish button in the admin site.

- Write some view or model unit tests that check ordering

- Refactor your views to use REVERSE lookups, that way if you change URL structuring, your tests will still pass
