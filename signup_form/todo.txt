Signup form unit/functional testing - todo list

-Find out what a CreateView generic view does, can this be used for this customer sign up form?
-Write a test that look at the validation errors in the form object's validation array. See test-driven-django-development unit testing forms web page
-Put in some javascript to automatically raise validation errors, and functional tests for them
-Refactor our functional tests so that instead of checking the database, it outputs the form content to a separate page, and we simply test the HTML output exists.
