Todo:
-Create a modelform for Superhero + appropriate unit tests for this modelform
-incorporate this modelForm into the DetailView - set up the view so that read_only users can see the data, but not edit. and users with write access get a pre-populated modelForm on page
-for users with 'delete' permissions, incorporate a working 'delete' button
-create an 'add to database' function + unit/functional tests

Functional test ideas:
-test that readonly can only see the data, no edit button or delete button is present
-test that write_access users can see and edit the data, but does not have a delete button
-test that delete_access users can do all of the above
-write other tests that ensure users without correct permissions, cannot do any of the above. 

Unit test ideas:
-create test data using a form without authenticated user, assert it didn't work
-create test data using a form with an authenticated user, assert it worked
