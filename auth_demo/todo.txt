Todo:
-start with functional tests, user story is a login page that takes you to a basic dashboard, where you can see a list of modelForms, ones for deletion, others for read-only view
-establish three base permissions - readonly, add and delete
-set up a group 'all_access' with all 3 base permissions included
-set up two users, assign one the permission 'readonly', the other the 'all_access' group 
-build a view "loginView"
-if loginView requires a separate form, create that too
-set up a page full of data that only autenticated users can see, use a pre-populated modelForm
-set up a page with data read from a test model, data that can be deleted
-since we're spiking, go back and fill out any remaining unit tests

Functional test ideas:
-sign up to site
-attempt to view page that user doesn't have permissions to read
-attempt to edit page that user doesn't have permission to edit
-attempt to delete data that user doesn't have permission to delete
-login to page, view data for read_only user
-login to page with read_only user and attempt to edit + delete data

Unit test ideas:
-check group 'all_access' has correct base permissions assigned
-assign a permission to a user, assert it worked (has_perm)
-assign a group to a user and assert it worked (for this test, create separate group with only read and add, but not delete)
-create a user, assert it worked
-create test data using a form without authenticated user, assert it didn't work
-create test data using a form with an authenticated user, assert it worked
