Useful code snippets for use in future Django projects

August 2018 - Ben Jacobson

In this repo are various code snippets for use in future Django projects. In some cases functional and unit tests are included to speed up development
test

Included in this repo:

- pizza_shop_models - In it's current form, its a demonstration of Django's ManyToMany database relationships. Similar to an example seen in the official documentation, it builds a Pizza model, and a Topping model and defines a many to many relationship between them. The purpose of this is to easily repurpose this code for real-world use. Unit tests are included and can also be refactored into future projects.
